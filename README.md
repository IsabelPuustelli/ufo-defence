To get straight to the point, this is a hobby project idea that I have been toying around with for a little while, that I'm finally hoping to bring to fruition. I've had many a project that have fizzled out after the first few weeks, so now I'm grabbing the bull by the horns. I'll document every bit of progress on dev.to, and store it all on git to keep myself glued to the project.

The Game

So far the game has simply been called "Project UFO Defence". You guessed it, it's inspired by the original XCOM from the year 1994, "X-COM: UFO Defence". I feel It's a style of game that hasn't really been recreated. Obviously I'm a big fan of the reboot franchise, but I just feel something about the game significantly changed bringing it to 3D, something that I'm hoping to put my twist on. I haven't done much designing yet for the game. I'll get on this as soon as the base systems are in place. It'll be a lot easier to design a lot of the systems and make changes once you have a feel as to how the game looks and plays on the very foundational level.
